so ok imagine a "{Place}" or something and it's got like these zones, and each of them has a size (in meters squared? math stuff), and they're all kinda touching or near each other, or not, but yeah they have like neighbors.

what i need is to figure out what kinda thing connects each of the zones to the others around them, like should there be a wall? or maybe like a door, or just nothing? open space? idk. pick one for each pair, but not like twice. like don’t say “A & B” and then again say “B & A” – we get it, it’s the same thing.

please base the connection thingies on stuff like... the whole vibe of the area, what the zones even do, if people should get in or not, and how big they are or something. also make sure no zone is stuck or lonely with no path, cuz they all need to be reachable by people or things or robots or whatever. every zone should have at least one way in. and like i said before (but just saying it again for no reason), don’t do duplicates.

here’s the stuff you need:
{Data}

and uhh respond ONLY with the format like this (no hellos or extra stuff or i’ll get confused lol):

{
	"Zone X&Zone Y": "Wall",
	"Zone Y&Zone Z": "Wall",
	"Zone A&Zone C": "Wall"
}
no fluff, just the thing.
