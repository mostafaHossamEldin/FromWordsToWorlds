yo so for this one thing called "{Place}" or whatever, can u tell me what stuff it's made of but like just the names of the parts and then the names of the parts inside those parts (like zones inside of more zones, you know what i mean?), but don’t say like anything super detailed like objects or whatnot, just give names for the places and only mention the little parts (like the final bottom zones) when you need to put numbers and measurements and stuff.

also make sure each small zone (leafs? leefs? the bottom ones) says how big it is like in square meters. and say how tall the walls are (only if they have walls tho), and where they are inside their parent part like “left” or “up” or “middle or center or whatever” – but only use right, left, up, down, or center or things will get weird.

for those bottom leaf ones give some objects (not a lot just the ones u would put on the floor if u were gonna build the zone from scratch) and name them with long names like “wooden table with drawer from school” and start with the object name and never make them plural. then tell me the sizes of each object in meters like [w, h, l] (like width and tallness and deepness). also for the tiny zones say if the floor is like stone or dirt or tile or whatever, and if there’s walls, what texture they are (like brick or goo idk).
